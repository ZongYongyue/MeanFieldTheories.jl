# Example: SDW-CDW Phase Diagram of Extended Hubbard Model

This example demonstrates the phase diagram of the extended Hubbard model on a 2D square lattice at half-filling, reproducing the competition between spin density wave (SDW/AFM) and charge density wave (CDW/CO) orders.

The ground state is found automatically using symmetry-breaking warmup restarts — no prior knowledge of whether SDW or CDW is the ground state is required.

## Physical Model

$$H = -t \sum_{\langle ij \rangle,\sigma} (c^\dagger_{i\sigma}c_{j\sigma} + \text{h.c.}) + U \sum_i n_{i\uparrow}n_{i\downarrow} + V \sum_{\langle ij \rangle} n_i n_j$$

- $t$: nearest-neighbor hopping (set to 1)
- $U$: on-site Coulomb repulsion (fixed at 4)
- $V$: nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion (swept from 0 to 2)

At half-filling two phases compete:
- **SDW/AFM** ($V/U \lesssim 1/4$): staggered magnetization $S(\pi,\pi) \neq 0$
- **CDW/CO** ($V/U \gtrsim 1/4$): staggered charge density $N(\pi,\pi) \neq 0$

The phase boundary is expected at $V_c = U/4 = 1$.

The order parameters are:

$$S(\pi,\pi) = \frac{1}{N_\text{cell}} \sum_i e^{i\mathbf{Q}\cdot\mathbf{r}_i} \frac{n_{i\uparrow} - n_{i\downarrow}}{2}, \qquad N(\pi,\pi) = \frac{1}{N_\text{cell}} \sum_i e^{i\mathbf{Q}\cdot\mathbf{r}_i} (n_{i\uparrow} + n_{i\downarrow})$$

with $\mathbf{Q} = (\pi,\pi)$.

## Method

The calculation uses **momentum-space unrestricted Hartree-Fock** (`solve_hfk`) on a $2\times2$ magnetic unit cell (4 sites × 2 spins → $d=8$) with a $2\times2$ $k$-grid (4 $k$-points). For each value of $V$, a single `solve_hfk` call with `n_restarts=10` and `field_strength=1.0` finds the ground state automatically. The phase is then determined by comparing the converged order parameters $S(\pi,\pi)$ and $N(\pi,\pi)$ directly.

This replaces the old approach of running twice from hand-crafted SDW and CDW initial conditions and comparing energies. Since both SDW and CDW are competing ordered phases, the random symmetry-breaking field explores both directions across different restarts.

## Code

```julia
# Lattice: 2×2 magnetic unit cell, sites at (0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)
dofs     = SystemDofs([Dof(:site, 4), Dof(:spin, 2, [:up, :dn])])
unitcell = Lattice([Dof(:site, 4)], [QN(site=i) for i in 1:4],
                   [[0.0,0.0],[1.0,0.0],[0.0,1.0],[1.0,1.0]];
                   vectors=[[2.0,0.0],[0.0,2.0]])

nn_bonds     = bonds(unitcell, (:p,:p), 1)
onsite_bonds = bonds(unitcell, (:p,:p), 0)

onebody = generate_onebody(dofs, nn_bonds,
    (delta, qn1, qn2) -> qn1.spin == qn2.spin ? -t_ext : 0.0)

kpoints = build_kpoints([[2.0,0.0],[0.0,2.0]], (2,2))
n_elec  = 4 * length(kpoints)   # half-filling

# On-site Hubbard U (built once, reused for all V)
U_ops = generate_twobody(dofs, onsite_bonds,
    (deltas, qn1, qn2, qn3, qn4) ->
        (qn1.spin == qn2.spin) && (qn3.spin == qn4.spin) && (qn1.spin !== qn3.spin) ? U_ext/2 : 0.0,
    order = (cdag, :i, c, :i, cdag, :i, c, :i))

# V sweep: ground state found automatically via symmetry-breaking restarts
for V in Vs
    V_ops = generate_twobody(dofs, nn_bonds,
        (deltas, qn1, qn2, qn3, qn4) ->
            qn1.spin == qn2.spin && qn3.spin == qn4.spin ? V/2 : 0.0,
        order = (cdag, :i, c, :i, cdag, :j, c, :j))

    twobody = (ops   = [U_ops.ops;   V_ops.ops],
               delta = [U_ops.delta; V_ops.delta],
               irvec = [U_ops.irvec; V_ops.irvec])

    r = solve_hfk(dofs, onebody, twobody, kpoints, n_elec;
        n_restarts     = 10,     # independent random restarts
        field_strength = 1.0,   # random symmetry-breaking field, O(t)
        n_warmup       = 15,     # field decays to zero after 15 iters
        tol            = 1e-8,
        verbose        = false)

    S_q, N_q, _, _ = observables(r.G_k)
    # Phase determined from converged order parameters, not from initial conditions
    phase = S_q >= N_q ? "SDW" : "CDW"
end
```

### Why this works for two competing phases

Unlike the AFM-only case, here both SDW and CDW are valid broken-symmetry ground states depending on $V$. The random Hermitian field $\Delta$ that is injected at each restart has no preferred spin or charge character — it breaks symmetry in a random direction in the full $d\times d$ orbital space, which covers both SDW-like (spin-polarized) and CDW-like (charge-polarized) perturbations. Different restarts explore different directions, and the solver retains the lowest-energy converged result. The phase is then read off directly from the dominant order parameter.

## Running the Example

```bash
# Step 1: run HF solver and save results
julia --project=examples -t 8 examples/SDW_CDW/run.jl

# Step 2: read res.dat and generate figure
julia --project=examples examples/SDW_CDW/plot.jl
```

`run.jl` will:
1. Sweep $V$ from 0 to 2 (20 points) at fixed $U=4$, $t=1$
2. For each $V$, run `solve_hfk` with 10 symmetry-breaking restarts
3. Compute $S(\pi,\pi)$ and $N(\pi,\pi)$ from the converged ground state
4. Determine the phase from the dominant order parameter
5. Save results to `res.dat`

`plot.jl` will read `res.dat` and save `docs/src/fig/sdw_cdw.png`.

## Results

The calculated phase boundary at $V_c = U/4 = 1.0$ and the order parameter curves are in complete agreement with Fig. 5(b) of Ref. [1].
